# Jessica Barhouane

**Data Analyst | Aspiring Data Engineer**

I work with data to uncover insights, improve operations, and support decision-making. I’m currently expanding my skills in:

- Python  
- SQL  
- Data Modeling  
- ETL Pipelines  
- Cloud Technologies (AWS / Azure)  
- Machine Learning Foundations  

I’m building projects that apply analytics and engineering principles to real-world datasets, and I’m gradually transitioning toward data engineering.
